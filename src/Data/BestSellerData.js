Kazi Farms Kitchen products do not contain any harmful preservatives. No Antibiotic Residue Chickens on farms are sometimes given antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. When people eat farmed chickens or products made from those chickens, they unknowingly consume 'residual' antibiotics, which may still have been in the chicken's body at the time of slaughter. This may end up building resistance to antibiotics in the human body. We guarantee that there are no residual antibiotics in Kazi Farms Kitchen products.",
